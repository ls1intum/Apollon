# @tumaet/apollon

## 4.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#766](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/766) [`5013fc6`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/5013fc632ea0e18c9fce5baf1f66f1d50617a358) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Adds undo/redo to shared (collaborative) diagrams. Undo and redo now work during a collaboration session, scoped to each person's own edits — undo reverts only your own changes, never a teammate's, and never overwrites an element someone else is editing. A whole drag or resize counts as a single step, your selection comes back with the change you undo, and everyone keeps seeing each other's edits move in real time.

- [#675](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/675) [`1bb280d`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/1bb280d23f9a4cfb9339a04b2311c1c50aeffae7) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Adds `@tumaet/apollon/export` — `svgToPng` and `svgToPdf` — for reliable in-browser PNG and vector-PDF export of an exported diagram SVG. The previous client approach rasterised through a `<canvas>`, which silently produced an empty PNG and a blurry, size-capped PDF once a diagram grew past the browser's canvas-area limit; these render off-canvas, so large diagrams export cleanly. `svgToPng` downscales a very large diagram to a pixel budget (reporting the applied scale) and throws `RasterTooLargeError` when it can't fit. Abstract-class names export upright, since the bundled Inter ships without an italic face.

### Patch Changes

- [#763](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/763) [`82942cd`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/82942cddec7d3dd33711d3f38eba92e10c1da0c9) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Fixes the editor gradually slowing down and freezing during long single-user editing sessions. Repeatedly dragging or resizing nodes no longer makes the diagram progressively heavier until the tab locks up — the editor stays responsive, and undo/redo and live collaboration behave exactly as before. Lining up nodes with the alignment guides is also lighter on every drag, which most affected long sessions in Firefox.

- [#761](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/761) [`5d4a8dd`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/5d4a8dd5d6d34d1c26d4258a99aadc02faca1c17) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - The editor palette, controls, and collaboration presence now adapt to compact portrait and landscape containers while respecting mobile safe areas.

## 4.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#765](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/765) [`6fe657c`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/6fe657cfabbb1f60936d03b758039fe1e7fade6f) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Headless and exported diagrams now render correctly and identically to the editor.

  - **Bundled Inter font.** The editor sizes diagram text by measuring it, but the library never shipped the Inter font it measures with — so it fell back to the host's `system-ui`, whose metrics differ between operating systems. That mismatch grew nodes past their saved positions and made exported diagrams overlap. Inter (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Vietnamese) now ships with the library, inlined into `style.css` (~+170 KB gzipped), pinning text geometry across the editor, exports, and external SVG renderers.
  - **Self-contained SVG export.** `ApollonEditor.exportModelAsSvg` now works in a headless browser without importing `@tumaet/apollon/style.css` — it brings the styling and font it needs. This fixes edges that could be drawn through node boxes and stops overhanging edge labels from being cropped. `compat`-mode exports embed the font so they open correctly in browsers, Inkscape, and PowerPoint.
  - **Published model JSON Schema ([#748](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/issues/748)).** The diagram model is now a stable, versioned, documented contract, shipped at `@tumaet/apollon/schema`.
  - The font stack is exported as `FONT_FAMILY` for hosts that re-render or post-process diagram text.

  See the new [Headless rendering](https://ls1intum.github.io/Apollon/library/api/headless-rendering) guide and the [Model JSON contract](https://ls1intum.github.io/Apollon/library/api/model-contract).

- [#762](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/762) [`21c6f99`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/21c6f9914b1ab24d79fa6f6d6527ca6260db8c43) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - feat: add `ApollonEditor.setElementHighlights()` for host-driven element highlighting

  Restores the per-element highlight capability that v3 exposed via the
  `UMLModelElement.highlight` field and `ApollonEditor.select()`, both of which
  were dropped in the v4 rewrite. Hosting apps (e.g. Artemis marking elements
  that are missing assessment feedback, or Athena marking elements that have
  automatic-feedback suggestions) can now call:

  ```ts
  editor.setElementHighlights(new Map([["element-id", "rgba(23,162,184,0.3)"]]))
  editor.setElementHighlights(null) // clear
  ```

  The highlight is a translucent overlay painted over each given node, edge, or
  class member id. It is an ephemeral view concern: it is not written into the
  model, not serialized by `get model`, and not shared with collaborators. A
  companion `getElementHighlights()` returns the current highlight record.

- [#764](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/764) [`1fc31cc`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/1fc31cc7c1d2c8dedb3555edb5d5d063f572acae) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Upgrade to React 19 and enable the React Compiler.

  `@tumaet/apollon` now targets React 19 — its `react` and `react-dom` peer dependencies are `^19.0.0`. The `<Apollon>` component takes `ref` as a regular prop (the `forwardRef` wrapper was removed); consumers passing a `ref` need no changes. The React Compiler auto-memoizes the editor, so the manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`memo` and the hand-rolled stale-closure workarounds have been removed, and node/edge popovers anchor via a callback ref instead of reading a ref during render.

### Patch Changes

- [#765](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/765) [`6fe657c`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/6fe657cfabbb1f60936d03b758039fe1e7fade6f) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Make the `compat` export render identically outside a browser (the standalone server, resvg, Inkscape, PowerPoint, macOS Preview), where it was previously corrupted in three ways. The fix is to fully resolve the SVG in one place — the library's `compat` export — instead of leaving browser-only features for downstream consumers to patch around:

  - **Cropped diagrams.** Under jsdom the off-screen editor reports a zero-size bounding rect, which the bounds math kept (`0 ?? fallback` evaluates to `0`) instead of falling back to each node's real width and height — so the export viewBox enclosed only node _positions_ and sliced off the rightmost and bottommost elements. A non-positive rect is now treated as unmeasured.
  - **Mangled class stereotypes.** Stereotype labels (`«interface»`, `«enumeration»`) used a relative `font-size` (`85%`) and cumulative `<tspan dy>` offsets — which browsers resolve but other renderers don't, so the guillemets ballooned over and overlapped the class name. Relative font sizes now resolve to absolute px and tspan offsets to absolute `y`.
  - **Mispositioned labels.** Node text is centred with `dominant-baseline`, which non-browser renderers ignore — drawing every label at the alphabetic baseline (too high). It's now resolved to an explicit `y`, so text lands where the editor puts it everywhere.

## 4.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#742](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/742) [`dfb4479`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/dfb4479bbf15671a6332c96b659efd9dd31c127b) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - The edge-type dropdown now shows a small preview of how each option renders — its real line style and arrowheads — so you can pick the right relationship at a glance, across class, component, deployment, use case, and BPMN diagrams.

### Patch Changes

- [#744](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/744) [`1fdb9bc`](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/commit/1fdb9bc70b2fcfc119619876d595b36eebb36f8a) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Fix live collaboration cursors showing up in the wrong place — or drifting outside the editor — when collaborators have different editor sizes (for example, when one has a side panel open). Remote cursors are now positioned relative to the modeling canvas instead of the browser window.

## 4.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#709](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/709) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - The editor can now render live cursors, a presence bar, and remote selection highlights itself: pass a `collaboration` option with the local `user` instead of building that overlay in your host app. Also exports the `collabColorFromName` and `randomCollabName` helpers.

- [#706](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/706) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Crossing edges now hop over one another (line jumps) instead of overlapping, keeping relationships readable in dense diagrams.

- [#710](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/710) Thanks [@FadyGergesRezk](https://github.com/FadyGergesRezk)! - Edge editing overhaul: bend handles move a single segment and snap to the grid, manually placed waypoints now survive endpoint reconnection (they were discarded before), the path updates live as you drag, and connection handles no longer overlap on short node sides or when zoomed out. Grid snapping is also finer (5px).

- [#681](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/681) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Follow another participant's viewport during a live session — the editor recenters and tracks their pan and zoom. Exposed through the `collaboration` option (`showFollow`, `followingClientId`) and a new `CollaborationViewport` type.

- [#691](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/691) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Add a first-class React API and split the package into two entry points.

  - `@tumaet/apollon/react` exports an `<Apollon>` component plus `ApollonProvider`, `useApollonEditor`, `useApollonEditorOrThrow`, and `useApollonSubscription`. It treats `react`, `react-dom`, `@mui/material`, `@emotion/react`, `@emotion/styled`, and `@xyflow/react` as peer dependencies so a React host resolves a single shared copy.
  - The default `@tumaet/apollon` entry stays framework-agnostic and bundles those dependencies, so non-React hosts install with zero peers.

  **When upgrading:**

  - React hosts: import from `@tumaet/apollon/react` and add the six peers above to your own dependencies.
  - Minimum Node is now 22 (was 20).
  - Removed the `ApollonOptions` fields `theme`, `copyPasteToClipboard`, `colorEnabled`, and `scale`, and the `theme` argument of `exportModelAsSvg`.
  - Low-level sync internals (`YjsSync`, format converters) moved to `@tumaet/apollon/internals` and are not covered by semver.

### Patch Changes

- [#680](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/680) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Alignment guides now favour the parent container when you drag near a nested element, instead of fighting with the children inside it — children still align among themselves.

- [#708](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/708) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Pressing a node's toolbar button (Edit, Delete, …) no longer drags the canvas, so the toolbar works reliably on touch screens.

## 4.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#663](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/663) Thanks [@tamang29](https://github.com/tamang29)! - Awareness API for live cursors and presence — subscribe to other clients' selection and cursor state, and broadcast your own.
- [#657](https://github.com/ls1intum/Apollon/pull/657) Thanks [@FelixTJDietrich](https://github.com/FelixTJDietrich)! - Editor primitives for hosting a version-history UX without disturbing the live Yjs document — preview mode, programmatic readonly, fit-to-view, and full-state broadcast.
